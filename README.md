# ANALYTICS 512: Data Visualization

## Course Info
- **Institution:** Harrisburg University
- **Instructor:** [Kevin Purcell, Ph.D.](http://kevin-purcell.com) 
- **Contact:** kevin@harrisburgu.edu
     

## Course Description:
The visualization, interpretation, and communication of data is a core competency of analytics.  This course takes advantage of the rapidly evolving tools and methods used to visualize and communicate data.  Key design principles are used to reinforce skills in visual and graphical representation.   

**Prerequisites:** Analytics 500


## Learning outcomes:
1. Evaluate a data visualization understanding how data is mapped to graphical properties.
2. Describe the order of accuracy of perceptual tasks and how this affects the choices made in constructing a visualization.
3. Critique a visualization based on its task efficacy and adherence to principles of visual perception.
4. Suggest improvements of a visualization to enhance its effectiveness.
6. Translate an analytical outcomes or graphical descriptions to a data visualization using R.
7. Rapidly develop visualizations using R to answer a question about data.
8. Combine tools for data manipulation and visualization, to collect and clean data to create dynamic visualizations.


## Course Materials

### Software
- open-source statistical language `R` and affiliated libraries

## Course conduct & Grading

*Moodle* is going to be our platform for all course activities. There are *five* main graded activities for this class: (1) visualization coding assignments, (2) reading/discussion assignments, (3) one data visualization project, (4) a project presentation, and (5) a final examination. This is a three credit course. The standard expectation for three credit graduate classes is that you will spend an average of **9 to 12 hours per week** on your course work.

**NOTES**  
- All work for this class **must** be submitted through the Moodle class portal.  
- **No** assignments will be accepted through email.  
- Late assignments will be results in an automatic **25%** point deduction (unless accompanied by a documented, **university accepted** excuse).


### Grading Criteria
Your final grade will be composed of the following:

- visualization coding exercises
- Reading/discussion assignments
- One data visualization project
- One project presentation
- One cumulative examination

All activities will be assigned **individually** unless mentioned in the assignment.

### Grading
Grading policy will follow university standards published on page 42 of the [University Handbook](http://harrisburgu.edu/lib/pdf/MSanalytics_program.pdf).

### Attendance Policy
Attendance policy will follow university standards published on page 35 of the [University Handbook](http://harrisburgu.edu/lib/pdf/MSanalytics_program.pdf).

It is important to realize that student performance is inversely correlated with absenteeism. ([Marburger 2010](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3200/JECE.37.2.148-155#.Vem6qp3BzGd)).  


## Minimum Technology Requirements
In order to have a quality learning experience in your online courses, the university requires that your primary computer (the computer used to access course materials and on which you will be required to install course specific software) meets or exceeds their [specifications](http://harrisburgu.edu/laptop-requirements/). My technology requirements follow [university standards](http://harrisburgu.edu/?s=technology+requirements)


## HU Core Competencies
At the conclusion of this course a student will have met the following core competencies that reflect HU's mission, skills are demonstrated by the student’s ability to:  

**Critical thinking and Problem Solving** 
- Identify and clarify the problem,
- Gather information,
- Evaluate the evidence,
- Consider alternative solutions,
- Choose and implement the best alternative.

**Communication**
- The core communication skills are demonstrated by the student’s ability to:
      + Express ideas and facts to others effectively through visual graphics.
      + Communicate effectively by collaborating with class discussions and forums.

**Information Technology**
- The students will be making effective use of the `R` statistical programming language, HTML5, Javascript libraries and the Tableau software platform.

**Competency Assessment:**
- One assignment in this class will also be assessed to evaluate your level of proficiency in an [HU core competency](http://www.harrisburgu.net/academics/core?competencies.php) directly connected to that assignment.  This competency assessment will not impact your grade in this course, but can be used as a gauge for you to self evaluate your progress in developing your skill level in specified core competencies attached to the assignment. 

## Statement on Academic Integrity
According to the University's Student Handbook: Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception, and is the educational objective of this institution.  Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, fabrication of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person, or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.  Any violation of academic integrity will be thoroughly investigated, and where warranted, punitive action will be taken. Students should be aware that standards for documentation and intellectual contribution may depend on the course content and method of teaching, and should consult the instructor for guidance in this area.
Honor Code.  We as members of Harrisburg University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work.  As a Community of Learners, we honor and uphold the HU Honor Code.

##  Introductions, Course planning, and Setup<a id="intro"></a>
This lecture will focus on reviewing the objectives and agenda for ANLY 580 Data Visualization.  In addition to setting the stage for the semester we will also take a tour through the historical development of the field of data visualization.  Luckily this subject has been thoughtfully studied and documented by a great many researchers.  I will lean heavily of the work of the Milestones Project an excellent academic endeavor to catalog and document the historic moments in the field of data visualization.  

For further information I encourage you to read Michael Friendly's excellent essay A Brief History of Data Visualization.  This material has also been published in a different form as a chapter in Handbook of Data Visualization.
